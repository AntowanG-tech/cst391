# Testapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Reasearch Questions

#### Research Question #1 

Inspect the default test project structure created in the Activity. Describe the purpose for each of the folders of the following in the project structure: node_modules, src, src/app, src/assets, and src/environments. Also, describe the purpose for each of the following files in the project: angular.json, package.json, and tsconfig.json.

### Answer

    The node modules folder is the home for all packages installed for the project's initial setup. No matter the framework, the packages are housed in that folder. The folder is also used by the package.json file. Therefore, the application will not run if the node modules folder has been removed or accidentally deleted. The “src” folder is shorthand for source which alludes to source code. The main body of code that is compiled when ran by the IDE is in the src folder. Src/assets houses the extra resources that make the application more pleasing to the eye. Images, icons, fonts, and other items are called assets in web development. The application uses these assets to improve the user experience in matters concerning design. Src/environments gives the context in which the code is compiled. An example would be listing the specific version of JS, node, Typescript, NPM, or Angular the project is using. This shows other developers what criteria the application must adhere to when working from a different machine. 

    The Angular.json file goes into more detail about the version of Angular being used, specifically. This file presents the version, build, location in which the source code is run from, the designated application to be run, and more. A project that uses Angular cannot be compiled without this file and will result in a fatal error if deleted. Package.json holds information of the application, scripts, and dependencies needed to run the project. If an additional dependency is needed, one simply needs to install it and it will automatically populate into the package.json file. Tsconfig is similar to the other json files but, lists the details and dependencies for Typescript.  

### Research Qeustion #2

Inspect the page source for the default page displayed when running the test project. Explain how the resultant page was generated by Angular by providing a brief overview and purpose for each of the following files: main.ts, app.component.css, app.component.html, app.component.ts, and app.module.ts. 

### Answer
    Main.ts a short file that acts as the “heart” of the application. It tells the server that the applicaiton should be run in a browser using the bootstrap module. App.component.css houses the design of the application’s user interface. CSS also known as Cascading Style Sheet allows artistic elements to a web page as to be aesthetically pleasing to the user. This file affects elements such as fonts, color, and text alignment. App.component.html is the file for the structure of the web page. Text, tables, navigation menus, and links are implemented to form this structure. App.module.ts is the root module of the project. The imports indicate that this file explains how the various parts of the application fit together. It lets the application know that it runs in the browser, declares the use of Bootstrap, and points Bootstrap to the index.html.
