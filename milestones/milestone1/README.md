# Milestone 1

- This is Milestone 1. The purpose of this assignment is to create the base documentation for the project ahead. 

## Introduction
- The application in development is the beginnings of a book tracker to account for the books on a “read” and “to be read” listing. The user will be able to create, read (display), update, and delete entries from these lists. The goal is to provide a user experience that is efficient in their book tracking needs. There will be two versions of this application modeled via Angular and React JS frameworks. It will not be browser specific. The user will benefit from the REST API while experiencing the Express backend technology. Attributes such as author, release date, and ratings will be available to the user in each entry.

Cheers! :beers:

## Functionality Requirements
- As a passionate book reader, I want an application that allows me to track all of the recent books I’ve read as well as those I wish to read in the future.

- As the developer, I want to provide the end user with a simple yet effective means of organizing their reading lists in to a “read” and “to be read” category. The books will possess information such as the author, release date, and a rating system. This way, the user can track which books they enjoyed the most. For the front end, one version will use Angular and the React framework for the other.

## Risks
- Time management is a critical risk that could be the undoing of the application. There are many factors that could affect this but, the solution for mitigation is to break down the application tasks into small chunks and deal with them accordingly. Another risk is not being able to format the pages UI/UX elements to meet the appearance goals. Extensive research on Angular and React will be needed to solve this issue.
